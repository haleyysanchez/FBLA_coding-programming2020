# FBLA_coding-programming2020

This repository is for my FBLA coding and programming competition project for the 2019-2020 school year. The topic of the program was to be able to track community service hours and awards of students and store the information persistently. The program utilized Tkinter to code the GUI and sqlite3 to manage the relational database. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

* Download this repository as a zip file and open 'main_file.py'
* Uncomment lines 18-30 and lines 74-102
* Then run the program for the first time
*  After running the program once comment lines 18-30 and lines 74-102 so that you dont enter that data into the database twice or create a second students table

### Prerequisites

Tkinter and sqlite3 are a part of the Python standard library and come with Python 3.x when it is downloaded.

## Built With

* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#tkinter-modules) - The GUI module used
* [SQLite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) - Relational database management system module used
